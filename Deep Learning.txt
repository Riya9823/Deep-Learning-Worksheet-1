11. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data. Deep learning 
    allows machines to solve complex problems even when using a data set that is very diverse, unstructured and inter-connected.
12. Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of 
    cumulative reward.
13. Machine learning uses algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned.
    Deep learning structures algorithms in layers to create an "artificial neural network” that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own.
14. The perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a
    vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.
15. Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”.
    Machine Learning is a current application of AI based around the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.
